# Metrics

Metrics to calculate errors on numeric previsions


## ME - Mean Error
Sum of errors (y - x) divided by the number of predictions

## MAE - Mean Absolute Error
Sum of absolute erros (|y - x|) divided by the number of predictions

## RMSE - Root Mean Squared Error
Square root of: sum of errors powered by 2 (y-x)^2 divided by the number of predictions

## MPE - Mean Percentage Error
sum of percentage of errors divided by the number of predictions

## MAPE - Mean Absolte Percentage Error
sum of percentage of absolute errors divided by the number of predictions
